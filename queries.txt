Given tables:
- tasks (id, name, status, project_id)
- projects (id, name)

1.Get all statuses, not repeating, alphabetically ordered

SELECT DISTINCT status
FROM tasks
ORDER BY status;


2.Get the count of all tasks in each project, order by tasks count descending

SELECT projects.id, COUNT(tasks.id) AS count_of_task
FROM tasks
RIGHT JOIN projects
ON tasks.project_id = projects.id
GROUP BY projects.id
ORDER BY count_of_task DESC;


3.Get the count of all tasks in each project, order by projects names

SELECT projects.name, COUNT(tasks.project_id) AS count_of_task
FROM tasks
RIGHT JOIN projects
ON tasks.project_id = projects.id
GROUP BY projects.id
ORDER BY projects.name;


4.Get the tasks for all projects having the name beginning with “N” letter

SELECT projects.name, tasks.name
FROM tasks
INNER JOIN projects
ON tasks.project_id = projects.id
WHERE tasks.name LIKE 'N%';


5.Get the list of all projects containing the ‘a’ letter in the middle of the
  name, and show the tasks count near each project. Mention that there can exist
  projects without tasks and tasks with project_id=NULL

SELECT projects.name, COUNT(tasks.id) AS count_of_task
FROM tasks
RIGHT JOIN projects
ON tasks.project_id = projects.id
WHERE projects.name LIKE '%a%'
GROUP BY projects.id;


6.Get the list of tasks with duplicate names. Order alphabetically

SELECT id, name
FROM tasks
WHERE name IN
 (SELECT name FROM tasks GROUP BY name HAVING COUNT(*) > 1)
ORDER BY name;


7.Get the list of tasks having several exact matches of both name and status,
  from the project ‘Garage’. Order by matches count

SELECT tasks.name
FROM tasks
RIGHT JOIN projects
ON tasks.project_id = projects.id
WHERE projects.name = 'Garage'
GROUP BY tasks.name, tasks.status
HAVING COUNT (tasks.id) > 1
ORDER BY COUNT (tasks.id);


8.Get the list of project names having more than 10 tasks in status ‘completed’.
  Order by project_id

SELECT projects.name
FROM tasks
RIGHT JOIN projects
ON tasks.project_id = projects.id
WHERE tasks.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY projects.id
HAVING COUNT (tasks.status) > 10
ORDER BY projects.id;
